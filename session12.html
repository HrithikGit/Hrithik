            DISCOVER MORE!
            Take a deep dive and try our list of over 40 unique generators, find placeholder images for your next design, or add a lorem ipsum plugin to the CMS or text editor of your choice.
            
            What is Lorem Ipsum?
            From its medieval origins to the digital era, learn everything there is to know about the ubiquitous lorem ipsum passage.
            
            Lorem ipsum used in a magazine layout
            MAGAZINE LAYOUT WITH LOREM IPSUM
            HISTORY, PURPOSE AND USAGE
            Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
            
            “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
            LETRASET TRANSFER SHEETS
            staging. It's like the props in a furniture store—filler text makes it look like someone is home. The same Wordpress template might eventually be home to a fitness blog, a photography website, or the online journal of a cupcake fanatic. Lorem ipsum helps them imagine what the lived-in website might look like.
            
            Second, use lorem ipsum if you think the placeholder text will be too distracting. For specific projects, collaboration between copywriters and designers may be best, however, like Karen McGrane said, draft copy has a way of turning any meeting about layout decisions into a discussion about word choice. So don't be afraid to use lorem ipsum to keep everyone focused.
            
            One word of caution: make sure your client knows that lorem ipsum is filler text. You don't want them wondering why you filled their website with a foreign language, and you certainly don't want anyone prematurely publishing it.
            
            Lorem Ipsum All the Things
            Coming full circle, the internet's remixing of the now infamous lorem ipsum passage has officially elevated it to pop culture status.

            BACON IPSUM GENERATOR
            BECAUSE IT'S THE INTERNET
            There was that time artists at Sequence opted to hand-Sharpie the lorem ipsum passage on a line of paper bags they designed for Chipotle—the result being a mixture of avant-garde, inside joke, and Sharpie-stained tables. Those with an eye for detail may have caught a tribute to the classic text in an episode of Mad Men (S6E1 around 1:18:55 for anyone that didn't). And here is a lorem ipsum tattoo.
            
            Of course, we'd be remiss not to include the veritable cadre of lorem ipsum knock offs featuring:
            
            Bacon Ipsum – Served all day. “Bacon ipsum dolor amet chicken turducken spare ribs.”
            
            Hipster Ipsum – In case you're in need of a “shoreditch direct trade four dollar toast copper mug.”
            
            Corporate Ipsum – “Leveraging agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis” from eight to five.
            
            Legal Ipsum – Fully unlicensed legalese for those times you don't want to pay $400/hr.
            
            Not to mention, Cupcake Ipsum, Bob Ross Ipsum (“happy little clouds”), and the furry Cat Ipsum. And in case that's not enough, check out our very own Ultimate List of Lorem Ipsum Generators.
            
            So there you have it. Lorem ipsum: the nonsense words unable to fully escape meaning.
            
            Original Source Text
            Below are the original Latin passages from which Lorem Ipsum was derived, paired with their 1914 translations by H. Rackham.
            
            Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum
            CICERO'S DE FINIBUS OPENING PAGE
            SECTION 1.10.32 OF CICERO'S “DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM”
            Original Latin text:
            
            “Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa, quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt, explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem, quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt, neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla pariatur?”
            Translation by H. Rackham:
            
            “But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?”
            SECTION 1.10.33 OF CICERO'S “DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM”
            Original Latin text:
            
            “At vero eos et accusamus et iusto t-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.</span>
